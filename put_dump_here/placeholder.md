Put the file (e.g. https://kaikki.org/dictionary/raw-wiktextract-data.jsonl.gz) in this directory.
Use the script 'get_files.sh' to get the file from the internet, and then use 'unzip_files.sh' to unzip the file.  Then, optionally delete the archive (not done by default.)
Next step: go to ../put_chunks_here to split the .jsonl into chunks.
